For two accumulation periods of time (24 hours and 48 hours) the main script:
1. read and save the accumulated precipitation values to disk (in the DATADIR folder)
1. generate and save the alerts file to disk (in the DATADIR folder)

## Usage in production mode
### STEP 1 - Clone the repository in your server using git
    git clone https://github.com/ITHACA-org/aux-accumul.git
